#backtick-orm

I was wondering what would be involved in building an ORM that depended on the command line and backticks to get data from a PostgreSQL database and then parse that data back into Ruby objects.

This is a proof of concept and is not really ever meant to be used in production. However, it was a great exercise and I think it could really help people learn how an ORM works!
